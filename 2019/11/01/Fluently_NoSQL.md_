# Fluently NoSQL

[.footer: Server Side Swift 2019, Copenhagen]

^ Hello! What an exciting conference, I cannot believe it's almost over!

^ I'm so excited to share with you the journey to getting an internal application deployed, and the components required to get there.

^ In particular, we'll talk about integrating Vapor's Fluent ORM with AWS' DynamoDB.

* Performance
* Efficiency
* Reliability
* Scalability


![100% right]

^ Lots of time spent with dynamic languages

^ Also a ton of time oncall, and as I'm bouncing between meetings or commutes, rarely have a comfortable way to use my laptop.

^ Would *love* to be able to use my phone for more incident response!

---- 

## Agenda

* Patient Road to Production
* DynamoDB
*   `AWSSDKSwift`
* Fluent DynamoDB

^ To build something that your customers rely upon, you need to have utmost confidence in its success.

^ That's not just something that can happen over a few months.

^ Need to maintain investment, understanding, and consider what work needs to be done now to enable you in the future.

---- 

## Ecosystem

![photo-1543133690-e427d2bdd1dd]

^ Swift on the server is *very* new 

^ I love the way the community is working together to build out the necessary frameworks for us to be successful.

^ Starting with shared, reusable components allows us to build on top of those, solving more specific problems each time.

## Introducing New Technology

![photo-1530319067432-f2a729c03db5]

^ Slack's core Web API is a monolithic application written in Hacklang on HHVM

^ Also have services in Java & Go for the real-time messaging stack

^ Tools written in Python, Shell, golang, and Swift

^ Need to be thoughtful of how & when to introduce a new stack

## Roadmap

![]

[.footer: Photo by Ryan Stone on Unsplash]

^ Start with small, well-scoped tools. For me, that meant finding command-line tools used for things like SSL Certificate management.

^ I also used to work directly on top of AWS, so it was important to have a reliable AWS client.

^ So worth your time to Invest in libraries, these will pay off.

^ As you amass these components, you'll find opportunity to combine technology interests with business use cases

----


## üõë Emergency Stop

1. What Loadtests are running right now?
2. How do I stop all loadtests NOW?

^ For me, that opportunity looked like a small service to assist with some major loadtest efforts we were performing.

^ As a Site Reliability Engineer, we have many tools in our tool belt.

^ Loadtesting and simulating large-scale events are powerful, but can be dangerous!

^ We wanted to be able to answer two questions quickly, so we built `Emergency Stop`.


---- 

(img)

^ We created a service, and integrated our 3 or 4 loadtesting tools to register themselves with Emergency Stop.

^ This allowed engineers and incident responders to track what experiments were in-flight

^ We also wanted a "big red button" to stop anything running immediately.

^ These tools would also query Emergency Stop to look for whether it was safe to proceed.

---- 

### Data Structure ‚Äî `ServiceLock`

1. **ServiceName** üåç  always  `global`
2. **Version** üìú A historical log
3. **IsIncidentOngoing** üî¥ the "red button"
4. **Username** üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Who flipped the switch?
5. **Timestamp** ‚åöÔ∏è When?
6. **Message**  ‚û°Ô∏è Where's the incident channel?

## End Goal

![]

^ This is our first service written in Swift, leveraging the language, standard library, and the APIs of Fluent & Vapor.

^ It's running on our internal kubernetes cluster via EKS.

## Low-risk Production Experience

![photo-1455747634646-0ef67dfca23f]

[.footer: Photo by Dawn Armfield on Unsplash]

^ Also an opportunity to battle-test the AWSSDKSwift

---- 

## Picking a Datastore (at Slack)

* MySQL
* Something Else

^ MySQL is the "supported" solution by our Database Reliability Engineering team, but requires maintenance, ongoing support, and an oncall rotation.

^ We wanted something as low-overhead as possible, able to be controlled by APIs and configuration, not chef and kernel reboots.

----


# DynamoDB

![]

[.footer: Photo by Ian Battaglia on Unsplash]

^ Announced by Amazon CTO Werner Vogels in 2012

^ Key-Value Storage

^ Denormalized Data

---- 

> Most of our services... store and retrieve data by primary key and do not require the **complex querying** and management functionality offered by an RDBMS. 

-- Dynamo Paper


^ Reading the Dynamo paper gives some insights into its usage. 

^ The infrastructure engineers realized that for their usecase, most teams were *not* taking advantage of the features offered by a SQL datastore.

^ If folks could give up some flexibility and take on some constraints, that opened up some interesting options!

---- 

## Key Concepts

[.build-lists: false]

1. Tables
2. Items & Attributes
3. Primary Keys

^ These are the "nouns" of DynamoDB.

---- 

### Table

1. Name
2. Hash Key
3. Range Key
4. Capacity

^ A table is just a collection of data records.

^ Very similar to a table in MySQL
‚Ä®^ It has a few properties, the Hash Key & optional Range Key compose the _primary key_

[.build-lists: false]

----

### Items

![]

[.footer: Photo by Karen Vardazaryan on Unsplash]

^ Single data record, or "row" in a table

^ Each item is uniquely defined by a Primary Key

----

### Attributes (Values)

[.build-lists: false]

- Scalars
	- Single items
- Collections
	- Groups of values

^ Each Item is composed of a group of Attributes

^ You can specify a single value or several

---- 

### Scalar Values

* `Binary`
* `Boolean`
* `Number`
* `Null`
* `String`

[.build-lists: false]

---- 
### Collection Values

1. `Binary Set`
2. `List`
3. `Map`
4. `Number Set`
5. `String Set`

[.build-lists: false]

---- 

### Primary Key

1. Simple Primary Key ‚Äî Hash Key
2. Composite Primary Key
	1. Hash Key
	2. Sort Key

^ Each item in a table is uniquely identified by a primary key.
‚Ä®^ There are two types.

^ A simple primary key made up of just a partition key. Similar to a "normal" KV store like Memcache.

^ A composite primary key made up of a partition key and a sort key. Enables complex queries.

---- 

## Scalars as Primary Keys

[.build-lists: false]

1. String
2. Numbers
3. Binary

^ These can all be used as primary keys

---- 


### Data Structure ‚Äî `ServiceLock`

1. üåç  `ServiceName` ( String ) ‚Äî Hash Key
2. üìú  `Version` ( Int ) ‚Äî Sort Key
3. üî¥  `IsIncidentOngoing` ( Bool )
4. üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  `Username` ( String )
5. ‚åöÔ∏è  `Timestamp`( String )
6. ‚û°Ô∏è  `Message` ( String )

---- 

resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "emergency_stop_service_lock" {
  name           = "emergency-stop-service-lock"
  read_capacity  = 10
  write_capacity = 10
  hash_key       = "ServiceName"
  range_key      = "Version"

  attribute {
    name = "ServiceName"
    type = "S"
  }

  attribute {
    name = "Version"
    type = "N"
  }
}

^ We're using Terraform to create a "resource"‚Äî a DynamoDB Table.

^ It's named `emergency-stop-service-lock`

^ Note the `hash_key` and `range_key` (or `sort_key` make up our composite Primary Key)

^ We set read/write capacity instead of specifying an instance size or anything like that.

^ This is very low write volume, and thanks to caching in the application relatively low read volume as well.

----

| Service Name | Version | Is Incident Ongoing | User name | Time stamp | Message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  global  | 1 | false  | Jim | 8/25/2019, 2:04:31 AM | Error! |
|  global  | 2 | true   | Joe | 8/27/2019, 7:13:40 PM | Fixed  |

^ So as an example, we can see the first value (at `Version` **1**) shows there was a problem, so the Emergency Stop was pressed.

^ It must've been a doozy, since it was fixed 2 days later.

----

| Service Name | Version | Is Incident Ongoing | User name | Time stamp | Message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  global  | 1 | false  | Jim | 8/25/2019, 2:04:31 AM | Error! |
|  global  | 2 | true   | Joe | 8/27/2019, 7:13:40 PM | Fixed  |

^ When you're querying, you can **only** access this by the composite primary key.

^ I'm not going to talk about it this time, but if you wanted "all times Joe hit the button" you would create a `Secondary Index` to track that.

^ **Secondary Indexes** provide an additional "view" or "rotation" on the data to enable additional access patterns.

----

## Scalability

![]

[.footer: Photo by Maria Molinero on Unsplash]

^ Unlike most relational databases, DynamoDB can scale "horizontally" assuming you plan your data model correctly

^ Note that you need to pick your Primary Key well, that's what Dynamo uses to determine which nodes host your data.
‚Ä®^ Choosing poorly means you'll have "hot shards" that are overloaded by too many requests!

# AWS SDK Swift

* Created by Yuki (**@noppoMan**)
* Major contributions from **@jonnymacs** and **@adam-fowler**

![]

[.footer: Photo by Levi Morsy on Unsplash]

---- 

## Two Components

* `aws-sdk-swift-core`
* `aws-sdk-swift`

![]

[.footer: Photo by Genevieve Perron-Migneron on Unsplash]

^ The Core solves authentication, encoding/decoding, an HTTP client, and error propagation.

^ The second part is the "main" SDK, which contains a Code Generator and the actual APIs & request/response Shapes

---- 

## AWS SDK Swift Core

![]

[.footer: Photo by Pawe≈Ç Czerwi≈Ñski on Unsplash]

^ We're going to walk through some of the functionality this provides, learning heavily from other language implementations.

----
## `CredentialProvider`

/// Protocol defining requirements for object providing AWS credentials
public protocol CredentialProvider {
    var accessKeyId: String { get }
    var secretAccessKey: String { get }
    var sessionToken: String? { get }
    var expiration: Date? { get }
}

^ The first thing you'll need to do is have credentials with appropriate permissions to make your API calls!

^Three ways to plug in your credentials.

^ Environment Variables
INI File (`~/.aws`)
Metadata Service (IAM or ECS Profile), which is the best practice.

---- 

## AWS SDK Swift Core ‚Äî Hashing

* üíª `CommonCrypto`
or
* üêß `CAWSSDKOpenSSL`

1. `hmac` ‚Äî hash-keyed message authentication code
2. `sha256`
3. `md5`

![]

[.footer: Photo by chris panas on Unsplash]

^ In order to properly sign and authenticate our requests, we need some cyptographic functionality.

^ We pick `CommonCrypto` if it's available on Darwin platforms, otherwise look for OpenSSL or LibreSSL.

^ We need an `hmac` function for nearly each part of the request signature, as well as `sha256` for the body and `md5`for S3.

---- 

## AWS SDK Swift Core ‚Äî `HTTPCLient`

public final class HTTPClient {
    public struct Request {
        var head: HTTPRequestHead
        var body: Data = Data()
    }
    
    public struct Response {
        let head: HTTPResponseHead
        let body: Data
        public func contentType() -> String?
    }
    
    public enum HTTPError: Error {
        case malformedHead, malformedBody, malformedURL
    }

	public init(url: URL, eventGroup: EventLoopGroup)

	public func connect(_ request: Request) -> EventLoopFuture<Response>

	public func close(_ callback: @escaping (Error?) -> Void)
}

^ We have our own low-level HTTP client.

^ We've considered migrating to the `AsyncHTTPClient`, but so far we've appreciated having the fine-grained control of this client we've been using for about a year or so.

---- 

public class AWSClient {
    public enum RequestError: Error {
        case invalidURL(String)
    }

	public var endpoint: String

	public static let eventGroup: EventLoopGroup

    public func signURL(url: URL,
						httpMethod: String,
						expires: Int = 86400) -> URL
...

^ The HTTPClient is wrapped by an `AWSClient`, which is the workhorse of the SDK. 

---- 

public func send<Output: AWSShape, Input: AWSShape>(
	operation operationName: String,
	path: String,
	httpMethod: String,
	input: Input) -> Future<Output> {
        return signer.manageCredential().thenThrowing { _ in
            let awsRequest = try self.createAWSRequest(
                operation: operationName,
                path: path,
                httpMethod: httpMethod,
                input: input
            )
            return try self.createNioRequest(awsRequest)
        }.then { nioRequest in
            return self.invoke(nioRequest)
        }.thenThrowing { response in
            return try self.validate(operation: operationName, response: response)
        }
}

^ When we want to make an API request, the first thing we're going to do is ensure we have credentials.

^ After that succeeds, we will use our input values to construct and sign the request with our credentials.

----

public func send<Output: AWSShape, Input: AWSShape>(
	operation operationName: String,
	path: String,
	httpMethod: String,
	input: Input) -> Future<Output> {
        return signer.manageCredential().thenThrowing { _ in
            let awsRequest = try self.createAWSRequest(

        }.thenThrowing { response in
            return try self.validate(operation: operationName, response: response)
        }
}

^ When that processing completes, we convert that into a HTTP request which will get sent over the wire thanks to NIO.

^ As soon as we get a response back from AWS, we'll decode the message (using the right decoder depending on the service!) and send that back to the user, wrapped in a Future.

---- 

public func send<Output: AWSShape, Input: AWSShape>(
	operation operationName: String,
	path: String,
	httpMethod: String,
	input: Input) -> Future<Output> {

            return try self.validate(operation: operationName, response: response)
        }
}

^ If it is not successful then `AWSClient` will throw an `AWSErrorType`.

---- 

## AWS SDK Swift Dynamo Client

1. `AttributeValue`
2. `getItem` / `putItem`
3. `query`

---- 

### `AttributeValue`
/// An attribute of type Binary. For example:
/// "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"
public let b: Data?

/// An attribute of type Boolean. For example:  "BOOL": true
public let bool: Bool?

/// An attribute of type Number. For example:  "N": "123.45"
/// Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
/// to maximize compatibility across languages and libraries.
/// However, DynamoDB treats them as number type attributes
/// for mathematical operations.
public let n: String?

/// An attribute of type Null. For example:  "NULL": true
public let null: Bool?

/// An attribute of type String. For example:  "S": "Hello"
public let s: String?

^ Calling out that Number is _not_ `Numeric`, but instead passed to Dynamo as a `String` !

---- 
### `AttributeValue`
/// An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
/// "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]
public let bs: [Data]?

/// An attribute of type List. For example: 
/// "L": [ {"S": "Cookies"} , {"S": "Coffee"}, {"N", "3.14159"}]
public let l: [AttributeValue]?

/// An attribute of type Map. For example:
/// "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}
public let m: [String: AttributeValue]?

/// An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
/// "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]
public let ns: [String]?

/// An attribute of type String Set. For example:
/// "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]
public let ss: [String]?

---- 

## Fetching a Single Item


///  The GetItem operation returns a set of attributes
/// for the item with the given primary key.
public func getItem(_ input: GetItemInput) -> Future<GetItemOutput> {
    return client.send(operation: "GetItem",
					   path: "/",
         	           httpMethod: "POST",
                       input: input)
}

^ This is very much like your traditional key-value store; the `input` contains a `key` to correspond with the primary key you want to retrieve.

^  If there is no matching item, GetItem does not return any data and there will be no Item element in the response.  

---- 

### `GetItemInput`

/// Determines the read consistency model
public let consistentRead: Bool?

/// A map representing the primary key of the item to retrieve.
public let key: [String: AttributeValue]

/// The name of the table containing the requested item.
public let tableName: String

^ This is a truncated view of this `GetItemInput`

^ GetItem provides an eventually consistent read by default, so you may get stale data.

^ If your application requires a strongly consistent read, set ConsistentRead to true.
  
^ Although a strongly consistent read might take more time than an eventually consistent read, it always returns the last updated value.

---- 

## Setting Items

///  Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item.
public func putItem(_ input: PutItemInput) -> Future<PutItemOutput> {
    return client.send(operation: "PutItem",
					   path: "/",
					   httpMethod: "POST",
					   input: input)
}

^ If an item that has the same primary key as the new item already exists in the specified table, the new item completely replaces the existing item. 

^ You can perform a conditional put operation (add a new item if one with the specified primary key doesn't exist), or replace an existing item if it has certain attribute values.

----

## Setting Items

///  Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item.
public func putItem(_ input: PutItemInput) -> Future<PutItemOutput> {
    return client.send(operation: "PutItem",
					   path: "/",
					   httpMethod: "POST",
					   input: input)
}

^ Conditional Expressions allow you to `put` an item only if its current value satisfies a constraint.

^ Use them to prevent overwriting with the `attribute_not_exists` conditional expression

---- 


### `PutItemInput`

/// A map of attribute name/value pairs.
public let item: [String: AttributeValue]

/// Use ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes
/// as they appeared before they were updated
public let returnValues: ReturnValue?

/// The name of the table to contain the item.
public let tableName: String


^ You must include the Primary key, but you can add many more attributes if necessary

^ Some rules: No `null` values, `String` & `Binary` must be longer than zero-length, and no empty values

^ You can return the item's attribute values in the same operation, using the ReturnValues parameter.

---- 

## Querying for Multiple Items

///  The Query operation finds items based on primary key values.
public func query(_ input: QueryInput) -> Future<QueryOutput> {
    return client.send(operation: "Query",
					   path: "/",
					   httpMethod: "POST",
					   input: input)
}


^  You can query any table or secondary index that has a composite primary key (a partition key and a sort key).  

^ A Query operation always returns a result set. If no matching items are found, the result set will be empty. 

^ Query results are always sorted by the sort key value. 

^ You can optionally narrow the scope of the Query operation by specifying a sort key value and a comparison operator in KeyConditionExpression. 

----

/// One or more substitution tokens for attribute names
/// in an expression.
public let expressionAttributeNames: [String: String]?

/// One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.
public let expressionAttributeValues: [String: AttributeValue]?

/// The condition that specifies the key values for items to
/// be retrieved by the Query action.
public let keyConditionExpression: String?

^ Use the KeyConditionExpression parameter to provide a specific value for the partition key. The Query operation will return all of the items from the table or index with that partition key value.

----

let nowDate = Date()
let earlierDate = now.addingTimeInterval(-60.0 * 60.0)

let now = formatter.string(from: nowDate)
let earlier = formatter.string(from: earlierDate)

let expressionAttributeNames = [
		"#S": "ServiceName",
		"#T": "Timestamp"]
let expressionAttributeValues = [
		":global": DynamoDB.AttributeValue(s: "global"),
		":then": DynamoDB.AttributeValue(s: earlier),
		":now": DynamoDB.AttributeValue(s: now)]

let keyConditionExpression = "#S = :global AND #T BETWEEN :then AND :now"

^ To walk us through an example, let's say we had a Seondary Index setup on `Timestamp`

^ We want to query for all the updates made within the last 60 minutes

^ We start off by defining what *names* we plan to use in our query, in this case `ServiceName` and `Timestamp`

^ Then we insert the values, we use the ISO 8601 date format.

^ Finally, we put that together in a `Key Condition` which we use to describe our constraints.

---- 

## AWS SDK Swift Dynamo Client

1. `AttributeValue`
2. `getItem` / `putItem`
3. `query`

[.build-lists: false]

^ There are some other, simpler APIs for Batch gets/puts, but that's the high-level overview.

^ However, now that we know what we do about the behavior of `PutItem`, that presents us with a problem.

----

## History of Changes
‚Ä®![]

^ When we're making changes to the button, we want to be able to maintain a historical log of changes over time.

[.footer: Photo by Daniel H. Tong on Unsplash]

----

| Service Name | Version | Is Incident Ongoing | User name | Time stamp | Message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  global  | 1 | false  | Jim | 8/25/2019, 2:04:31 AM | Error! |
|  global  | 2 | true   | Joe | 8/27/2019, 7:13:40 PM | Fixed |

^ This looks great, but... we don't actually have a way to get "latest value" without doing a full table scan!

^ And if we remove the `Version` field entirely, updates will overwrite the value

^ Using that data model is fine for a single value you don't want or need the history for this

----

| Service Name | Version | Is Incident Ongoing | User name | Time stamp | Message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  global  | 1 | false  | Jim | 8/25/2019, 2:04:31 AM | Error! |
|  global  | 2 | true   | Joe | 8/27/2019, 7:13:40 PM | Fixed |

^ This provides a challenge‚Äî when we think of something that we want a log, how could we represent this?

^ In SQL, you could just have the DB generate a new ID for you

^ Then when you are looking for the current state, look at the latest value

^ There's a setup for that with Dynamo, and Amazon has a pattern they suggest for this.

---- 

| Service Name | Version | Is Incident Ongoing | User name | Time stamp | Message | Current |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  global  | 0 | true   | Joe | 8/27/2019, 7:13:40 PM | Fixed | 2 |
|  global  | 1 | false  | Jim | 8/25/2019, 2:04:31 AM | Error! | |
|  global  | 2 | true   | Joe | 8/27/2019, 7:13:40 PM | Fixed | |

^ Here you notice we've added a new field, as well as a new "default" row at 0.

^ The row with `Version = 0` is special, it's _always_ considered the latest version.
‚Ä®^ It's also the only item with a value for `Current`; that's a pointer to the latest row.

---- 

| Service Name | Version | Is Incident Ongoing | User name | Time stamp | Message | Current |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  global  | 0 | true   | Joe | 8/27/2019, 7:13:40 PM | Fixed | 2 |
|  global  | 1 | false  | Jim | 8/25/2019, 2:04:31 AM | Error! | |
|  global  | 2 | true   | Joe | 8/27/2019, 7:13:40 PM | Fixed | |

^ When we want to make an update, we can perform a conditional `Put` on version `0` to only increment the version if the value is still `2`.

^ We can also use a transaction to add row `3` at the same time.

---- 

## Denormalized Data

^ So the lesson I learned here was to focus on how to utilize the structures available to create an appropriate access pattern.

^ With a SQL database, you're going to create separate patterns that require completely different setups.

^ With Dynamo, whether you creating an additional Secondary Index or changing your data pattern, you're considering how your application will read your data ahead of time.
‚Ä®^ Once you set the data access patterns, they're largely locked in stone unless you add another Index (which has limits)

## Fluent 3 Concepts

1. `Database`

##  DatabaseConnection

^ The DatabaseConnection is what I'd consider the core to actually work with your underlying db.

^ This takes the AWS client library and makes the proper calls based on the query.

----

public protocol DatabaseConnection: DatabaseConnectable, Extendable {
    /// This connection's associated database type.
    associatedtype Database: DatabaseKit.Database
        where Database.Connection == Self
    
    /// If `true`, this connection has been closed and is no
	/// longer valid.
    /// This is used by `DatabaseConnectionPool` to prune
	/// inactive connections.
    var isClosed: Bool { get }

    /// Closes the `DatabaseConnection`.
    func close()
}

---- 

public final class DynamoConnection: DatabaseConnection {
    public typealias Database = DynamoDatabase

    public var isClosed: Bool {
        return self.handle.isClosed()
    }

    public func close() {
        self.handle.close()
    }

    /// Reference to parent `DynamoDatabase` that created this connection.
    private let database: DynamoDatabase

    internal private(set) var handle: DynamoDB!

    internal init(database: DynamoDatabase, on worker: Worker) throws {
        self.database = database
        self.eventLoop = worker.eventLoop
        self.handle = database.openConnection()
    }
}

^ For us, we can make sure the underlying EventLoop is closed for our DynamoDB client.

## üòª `Provider`

public protocol Provider {
    /// Register all services you would like to provide the `Container` here.

    func register(_ services: inout Services) throws

    func willBoot(_ container: Container) throws -> Future<Void>

    /// Called after the container has fully initialized and after `willBoot(_:)`.
    func didBoot(_ container: Container) throws -> Future<Void>
}

^ `Provider`s allow third-party services to be easily integrated into a service `Container`.

^ Providers first register, and have access to a `Services` struct they can mutate. After all providers register, there's a boot phase.

^ Most of your "real work" that isn't registering related services should be in `didBoot`

----

/// üíß The Provider expected to be registered to easily allow
/// usage of DynamoDB from within a Vapor application
public struct FluentDynamoDBProvider: Provider {
    public func register(_ services: inout Services) throws {
        try services.register(FluentProvider())

        services.register(DynamoConfiguration.self)
        services.register(DynamoDatabase.self)
        var databases = DatabasesConfig()
        databases.add(database: DynamoDatabase.self, as: .dynamo)
        services.register(databases)
    }
    
    public func didBoot(_ container: Container) throws -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        return .done(on: container)
    }
}

^ We want to make sure both the configuration and Database are available during configuration.

^ We also want to add Dynamo as an available DB.

^ Note that we're using the `.dynamo` Database Identifier.

let dynamoConfiguration =  DynamoConfiguration(accessKeyId: creds.accessKey,
